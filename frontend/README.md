Time to get your hands on your keyboard. Look at the first step you wrote down and start implementing!
As you work through setting up redux, you can do it however you'd like. This is the flow that works for me:
Set up "empty" reducer and initial state 👉 Set up store and Provider 👉
Connect components 👉 Add events and event handlers in UI 👉 Build action creators 👉
write the reducer logic for the actions 👉 Rinse and repeat
MVP Requirements:
Move the given state to the reducer as the initial state for the Redux store.
Set up the Redux flow
User should be able to add features to their car
User should be able to remove added features from their car
Total should update as user adds and removes features from their car
Task 3: Stretch Problems
Do not attempt stretch problems until MVP has been reached and a final commit has been made.

Use Redux hooks instead of HOCs
Implement React-Router and add a starter page where the user can choose a car. Each car should have different features that have different pricing. Have fun with this! It could end up being really cool.
Look into the docs for Bulma and change up the styling.
Implement an API from one of these sites here. I don't know if there are any good open APIs for this, so explore around. Check out what data these APIs return, and what you think would be fun to work with. The sky is the limit here!
